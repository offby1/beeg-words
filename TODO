* Persist to "the cloud"

Instead of (or in addition to) saving to the shared preference,
somehow sync the data to the cloud, so that if I install the same app
on another device, it sees the same text.

* Fix alignment in landscape mode

Try this: type ths single word "stuff." in landscape mode; at least
on the Nexus 7 the upper bits of the fs are cut off.

* Fix the lone bug

Put the tablet in portrait mode; enter "what what" and hit Done;
rotate it.  You will see "what whatwhat" in the EditText (although the
big FunkyTextView still correctly shows "what what").
