* An easy way to clear the entered text.
i.e., some sorta "clear" button.

* At each keypress, add the text to a display area
... thus starting the "Big Words" project.  Right now it's "line
oriented": nothing changes in the display area until you click the
"Done" button on the keyboard.

might be where to look if I need to write my own "Input Method
Editor", given that the built-in keyboard seems not to deliver
individual keypresses.

http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/inputmethod/InputConnection.html
might also be useful; it has a "sendKeyEvent" method.

mentions "dispatchKeyEvent"

* Figure out how to scale the text
Right now the text in the display area is whatever small font size I
chose when I created the project.

    This may be tricky -- to do it right, I need to figure out the size
    of the display area in pixels, the size of the _currently_ displayed
    text in pixels, compute the ratio, and then apply that scale factor
    to whatever font size is currently active.

looks like the attribute to fiddle.
